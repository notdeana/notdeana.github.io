<p>The purpose and story behind the video is that one of the players is feeling concerned about their way of life. As he asks his partner for her opinion, she gives a him her response. As their conversation continues, he no longers confides in his partner and ends his life. I feel like this represents alot of our way of life and how our relationships with other people can fall apart. Of course, this video seems lighthearted and comdeic in a way, but also carries out a serious message. </p>
<p>For this project, i recorded it through a program that was able to record my gameplay. With the help of my boyfriend, i was able to record the scenes together. I at first didn't know what to do for this project, but after awhile i got an idea of what i wanted to write.</p>
