  <p>The purpose and story behind the objects I chose to model is heavily based off the free pc downloadable action packed mmorpg called Maplestory. The model very much resembles that of maplestory 2, however the references I've chosen heavily come from the original maplestory game. This is the map I based the model off of. I chose this as a model subject because I have this sort of relation to it as I grew up playing the mmorpg. From my young elementary school days to even now, maplestory is still a great game to play by yourself or with friends and that is what pushed me to make this model. And maplestory is still better than maplestory 2.</p>
  <p>For this model, I wanted to add my own personal touch to it by sculpting the mushroom houses through meshmixer, as well as the platform it sits on. Other miscellaneous details, such as the smaller mushrooms, are borrowed from turbosquid and google polly. I initially wanted to add the stone texture on the side but unfortunately, the file became too big for sketchfab to upload it all the way.</p>
